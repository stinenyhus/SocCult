##Trying out the network tutorial

# Following best practices, we begin by setting up the workspace

p_load(statnet, tidyverse, magrittr, ggnetwork, EpiModel) #Last two are dedicated diffusion
#install.packages("netdiffuseR") #This does not work


# Typically, the purpose of a diffusion simulation is to illustrate the effects
# of a new diffusion process, or a new type of network structure, on the
# ultimate results of a diffusion process.  As such diffusion simulations are 
# highly variable -- after all, the point for each one is to show something new!

# However, despite the variability, most diffusion simulations build on a
# common set of building blocks:
# - an underlying network structure,
# - a transmission process, and
# - a running timer.
# In essence, we are defining an algorithm, or a set of rules, for how people
# get "infected" with a social contagion, and looking at how those rules perform
# under differnt conditions.

# To simulate random mixing, we construct the following rules:
# 1. Set up a world with a fixed number of people and a small fraction of 
#    initial infections, arranged randomly as a network
# 2. Pick an edge at random
# 3. If the edge is discordant (a susceptible-infected connection), flip a coin
#    to determine whether the non-infected person gets infected
# 4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until everyone is infected, or until a certain number
#    of steps has passed

### Step 2: Choose a person & neighbors at random as an initial adopter ###
# Set up vector to indicate adoption
adopters <- rep(F, 50)
adopters

# Choose a person at random
initial.adopter <- sample(seq_len(n), size = 1)

# Get the list of people they're attached to
initial.neighbors <- get.neighborhood(sw.net, initial.adopter)
initial.neighbors


# Set them all as "adopters"
adopters[c(initial.adopter, initial.neighbors)] <- T

### Step 3: infect all people who have more than tau neighbors infected ###


# We can update everyone simultaneously using matrix multiplication
adj.mat <- sw.net[, ]
diag(adj.mat) <- 0  # set the diagonal to 0, b/c people don't weight themselves

adj.mat <- moore_re[, ]
diag(adj.mat) <- 0 

adj.mat <- g5[, ]
adj.mat
diag(adj.mat) <- 0 

# We could take the sum...
adj.mat %*% adopters

#... or the percentage
(adj.mat.rn <- adj.mat / rowSums(adj.mat))
246/99/4
0.25-0.0062
0.62*4*99 + 4

p <- adj.mat.rn %*% adopters
p

# And then we calculate the people who are above our threshold
(adj.mat.rn %*% adopters) >= tau

# Note that this actually allows people to abandon the innovation if enough of
# of their neighbors are not adopters.  For now we don't want that to happen, 
# so we'll only test people who are not yet adopters
ifelse(adopters, TRUE, ((adj.mat.rn %*% adopters) >= tau))

### Step 4: Repeat ###
# Again, we can take care of this by wrapping it in a loop
adopt <- vector(mode = "list", length = max.time)
adopt[[1]] <- adopters
adopt[[1]]
